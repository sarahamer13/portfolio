    "description": "Hi there! I'm Sarah Mahdi — a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) and Scrum Master (CSM) with a unique background that blends healthcare, military service, and technology. I began my career as a linguist and cultural advisor in the U.S. military, then moved into the pharmaceutical industry, where I gained deep experience in regulated workflows, patient access, and cross-functional collaboration. My passion lies in building impactful digital products that improve people’s lives. I’ve led projects across software development, product ownership, and data analysis, and I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity Engineering. My work sits at the intersection of security, user experience, and value delivery. With a mission-driven mindset and a strong foundation in Agile product management, I specialize in translating complex challenges into practical, user-centered solutions. Whether it's launching an MVP, managing a backlog, or shaping secure systems, I thrive on creating products with purpose."
